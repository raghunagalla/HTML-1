        Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 14th century.
        [3].It is a fortified city. Chronicles left by Persian and European
        travellers, particularly the Portuguese, say that Hampi was a
        prosperous, wealthy and grand city near the Tungabhadra River, with
        numerous temples, farms and trading markets. By 1500 CE,
        Hampi-Vijayanagara was the world's second-largest medieval-era city
        after Beijing, and probably India's richest at that time, attracting
        traders from Persia and Portugal. The Vijayanagara Empire was defeated
        by a coalition of Muslim sultanates; its capital was conquered, pillaged
        and destroyed by sultanate armies in 1565, after which Hampi remained in
        ruins.
